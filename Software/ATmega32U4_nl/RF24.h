 * @page Arduino Arduino
 * 
 * RF24 is fully compatible with Arduino boards <br>
 * See <b> http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Board </b> and <b> http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI </b> for more information
 * 
 * RF24 makes use of the standard hardware SPI pins (MISO,MOSI,SCK) and requires two additional pins, to control
 * the chip-select and chip-enable functions.<br>
 * These pins must be chosen and designated by the user, in RF24 radio(ce_pin,cs_pin); and can use any 
 * available pins.
 * 
 * <br>
 * @section ARD_DUE Arduino Due
 * 
 * RF24 makes use of the extended SPI functionality available on the Arduino Due, and requires one of the
 * defined hardware SS/CS pins to be designated in RF24 radio(ce_pin,cs_pin);<br>
 * See http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DueExtendedSPI for more information
 *
 * Initial Due support taken from https://github.com/mcrosson/RF24/tree/due
 *
 * <br>
 * @section Alternate_SPI Alternate SPI Support
 *
 * RF24 supports alternate SPI methods, in case the standard hardware SPI pins are otherwise unavailable.
 * 
 * <br>
 * **Software Driven SPI**
 *
 * Software driven SPI is provided by the <a href=https://github.com/greiman/DigitalIO>DigitalIO</a> library
 *
 * Setup:<br>
 * 1. Install the digitalIO library<br>
 * 2. Open RF24_config.h in a text editor. 
      Uncomment the line 
      @code
      #define SOFTSPI
      @endcode
      or add the build flag/option
      @code
      -DSOFTSPI
      @endcode
 * 3. In your sketch, add
 *     @code
 *     #include DigitalIO.h
 *     @endcode
 *
 * @note Note: Pins are listed as follows and can be modified by editing the RF24_config.h file<br>
 *
 *     #define SOFT_SPI_MISO_PIN 16
 *     #define SOFT_SPI_MOSI_PIN 15
 *     #define SOFT_SPI_SCK_PIN 14
 * Or add the build flag/option
 *
 *     -DSOFT_SPI_MISO_PIN=16 -DSOFT_SPI_MOSI_PIN=15 -DSOFT_SPI_SCK_PIN=14
 *
 * <br>
 * **Alternate Hardware (UART) Driven  SPI**
 *
 * The Serial Port (UART) on Arduino can also function in SPI mode, and can double-buffer data, while the 
 * default SPI hardware cannot.
 *
 * The SPI_UART library is available at https://github.com/TMRh20/Sketches/tree/master/SPI_UART
 * 
 * Enabling:
 * 1. Install the SPI_UART library
 * 2. Edit RF24_config.h and uncomment #define SPI_UART
 * 3. In your sketch, add @code #include <SPI_UART.h> @endcode
 *
 * SPI_UART SPI Pin Connections:
 * | NRF |Arduino Uno Pin|
 * |-----|---------------|
 * | MOSI| TX(0)         |
 * | MISO| RX(1)         |
 * | SCK | XCK(4)        |
 * | CE  | User Specified|
 * | CSN | User Specified|
 *
 *
 * @note SPI_UART on Mega boards requires soldering to an unused pin on the chip. <br>See
 * https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24/issues/24 for more information on SPI_UART.
 * 
 * @page ATTiny ATTiny
 *
 * ATTiny support is built into the library, so users are not required to include SPI.h in their sketches<br>
 * See the included rf24ping85 example for pin info and usage
 * 
 * Some versions of Arduino IDE may require a patch to allow use of the full program space on ATTiny<br>
 * See https://github.com/TCWORLD/ATTinyCore/tree/master/PCREL%20Patch%20for%20GCC for ATTiny patch
 *
 * ATTiny board support initially added from https://github.com/jscrane/RF24

 *    **ATtiny25/45/85 Pin map with CE_PIN 3 and CSN_PIN 3** => PB3 and PB4 are free to use for application <br>
 *    Circuit idea from http://nerdralph.blogspot.ca/2014/01/nrf24l01-control-with-3-attiny85-pins.html <br>
 *   Original RC combination was 1K/100nF. 22K/10nF combination worked better.                          <br>
 *	For best settletime delay value in RF24::csn() the timingSearch3pin.ino sketch can be used.         <br>
 *    This configuration is enabled when CE_PIN and CSN_PIN are equal, e.g. both 3                      <br>
 *    Because CE is always high the power consumption is higher than for 5 pins solution                <br>

 * @page CrossCompile Linux cross-compilation
 * 
 * RF24 library supports cross-compilation. Advantages of cross-compilation:
 *  - development tools don't have to be installed on target machine
 *  - resources of target machine don't have to be sufficient for compilation
 *  - compilation time can be reduced for large projects
 *
 *  Following prerequisites need to be assured:
 *  - ssh passwordless access to target machine (https://linuxconfig.org/passwordless-ssh)
 *  - sudo of a remote user without password (http://askubuntu.com/questions/334318/sudoers-file-enable-nopasswd-for-user-all-commands)
 *  - cross-compilation toolchain for your target machine; for RPi
 *  @code git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools rpi_tools @endcode
 *  and cross-compilation tools must be in PATH, for example
 *  @code export PATH=$PATH:/your/dir/rpi-tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin @endcode
 *
 * @section CxSteps Cross compilation steps:
 * 1. clone RF24 to a machine for cross-compilation
 * @code
 * git clone https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24
 * cd RF24
 * @endcode
 * 2. configure for cross compilation
 * @code ./configure --remote=pi@target_linux_host @endcode
 * eventually
 * @code ./configure --remote=pi@target_linux_host --driver=<driver> @endcode
 * 3. build
 * @code make @endcode
 * 4. (opt) install library to cross-compilation machine into cross-exvironment - important for compilation of examples
 * @code sudo make install @endcode
 * 5. upload library to target machine
 * @code make upload @endcode
 * 6. (opt) compile examples
 * @code
 * cd examples_linux
 * make
 * @endcode
 * 7. (opt) upload examples to target machine
 * @code make upload @endcode
 *
 * @section CxStepsPython Cross comilation steps for python wrapper
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Python setuptools must be installed on both target and cross-compilation machines
 *   @code sudo pip install setuptools @endcode
 *   or
 *   @code sudo apt-get install python-setuptools @endcode
 *
 * Installation steps:
 * 1. Assure having libboost-python-dev library in your cross-compilation environment. Alternatively, you can install it into your target machine and copy /usr and /lib directories to the cross-compilation machine.
 * For example
 * @code
 * mkdir -p rpi_root && rsync -a pi@target_linux_host:/usr :/lib rpi_root
 * export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/your/dir/rpi_root -I/your/dir/rpi_root/usr/include/python2.7/"
 * @endcode
 *
 * 2. Build the python wrapper
 * @code
 * cd pyRF24
 * ./setup.py build --compiler=crossunix
 * @endcode
 *
 * 3. Make the egg package
 * @code ./setup.py bdist_egg --plat-name=cross @endcode
 * dist/RF24-<version>-cross.egg should be created.
 *
 * 4. Upload it to the target machine and install there:
 * @code
 * scp dist/RF24-*-cross.egg pi@target_linux_host:
 * ssh pi@target_linux_host 'sudo easy_install RF24-*-cross.egg'
 * @endcode

 *
 * @page ATXMEGA ATXMEGA
 * 
 * The RF24 driver can be build as a static library with Atmel Studio 7 in order to be included as any other library in another program for the XMEGA family.
 *
 * Currently only the <b>ATXMEGA D3</b> family is implemented.
 * 
 * @section Preparation 
 * 
 * Create an empty GCC Static Library project in AS7.<br>
 * As not all files are required, copy the following directory structure in the project:
 * 
 * @code
 * utility\
 *   ATXMegaD3\
 *     compatibility.c
 *     compatibility.h
 *     gpio.cpp
 *     gpio.h
 *     gpio_helper.c
 *     gpio_helper.h
 *     includes.h
 *     RF24_arch_config.h
 *     spi.cpp
 *     spi.h
 * nRF24L01.h
 * printf.h
 * RF24.cpp
 * RF24.h
 * RF24_config.h
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @section Usage
 * 
 * Add the library to your project!<br>
 * In the file where the **main()** is put the following in order to update the millisecond functionality:
 * 
 * @code
 * ISR(TCE0_OVF_vect)
 * {
 * 	update_milisec();
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Declare the rf24 radio with **RF24 radio(XMEGA_PORTC_PIN3, XMEGA_SPI_PORT_C);**
 * 
 * First parameter is the CE pin which can be any available pin on the uC.
 * 
 * Second parameter is the CS which can be on port C (**XMEGA_SPI_PORT_C**) or on port D (**XMEGA_SPI_PORT_D**). 
 * 
 * Call the **__start_timer()** to start the millisecond timer.
 * 
 * @note Note about the millisecond functionality:<br>
 * 
 * 	The millisecond functionality is based on the TCE0 so don't use these pins as IO.<br>
 * 	The operating frequency of the uC is 32MHz. If you have other frequency change the TCE0 registers appropriatly in function **__start_timer()** in **compatibility.c** file for your frequency. 
 *
 * @page Portability RF24 Portability
 *
 * The RF24 radio driver mainly utilizes the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/reference/homePage">Arduino API</a> for GPIO, SPI, and timing functions, which are easily replicated
 * on various platforms. <br>Support files for these platforms are stored under RF24/utility, and can be modified to provide 
 * the required functionality.
 * 
 * <br>
 * @section Hardware_Templates Basic Hardware Template
 *
 * **RF24/utility**
 *
 * The RF24 library now includes a basic hardware template to assist in porting to various platforms. <br> The following files can be included
 * to replicate standard Arduino functions as needed, allowing devices from ATTiny to Raspberry Pi to utilize the same core RF24 driver.
 *
 * | File               |                   Purpose                                                    | 
 * |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
 * | RF24_arch_config.h | Basic Arduino/AVR compatibility, includes for remaining support files, etc   | 
 * | includes.h         | Linux only. Defines specific platform, include correct RF24_arch_config file | 
 * | spi.h              | Provides standardized SPI ( transfer() ) methods                         | 
 * | gpio.h             | Provides standardized GPIO ( digitalWrite() ) methods                        | 
 * | compatibility.h    | Provides standardized timing (millis(), delay()) methods                     | 
 * | your_custom_file.h | Provides access to custom drivers for spi,gpio, etc                          | 
 *
 * <br>
 * Examples are provided via the included hardware support templates in **RF24/utility** <br>
 * See the <a href="modules.html">modules</a> page for examples of class declarations 
 *
 *<br>
 * @section Device_Detection Device Detection
 *
 * 1. The main detection for Linux devices is done in the configure script, with the includes.h from the proper hardware directory copied to RF24/utility/includes.h <br>
 * 2. Secondary detection is completed in RF24_config.h, causing the include.h file to be included for all supported Linux devices <br>
 * 3. RF24.h contains the declaration for SPI and GPIO objects 'spi' and 'gpio' to be used for porting-in related functions.
 *
